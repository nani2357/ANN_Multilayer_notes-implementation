# ANN_Multilayer_notes-implementation

This repository contains comprehensive notes and practical implementations of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with a focus on multi-layer architectures. It serves as a valuable resource for anyone looking to understand and implement multi-layer ANNs from scratch.

### Key highlights of this repository include:

Multi-layer ANN Implementation: Detailed step-by-step implementation of multi-layer ANNs using popular machine learning libraries. This includes data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and prediction.

TensorBoard Usage: Comprehensive guide on how to use TensorBoard for tracking and visualizing metrics during the training of neural networks. This includes how to set up and start TensorBoard within a notebook environment.

Callbacks: Practical examples of how to use callbacks in Keras, such as ModelCheckpoint for saving models during training, and EarlyStopping for stopping training when a monitored metric has stopped improving.

Notes: Detailed notes explaining the theory behind ANNs, including the mathematics and intuitions behind various concepts. These notes serve as a great starting point for anyone new to the field.

Mathematical Intuitions: The repository provides a deep dive into the mathematical intuitions behind ANNs, helping you understand the why and how of various techniques and methodologies used in the field of deep learning.

Whether you're a beginner just starting out in deep learning or an experienced practitioner looking to brush up your knowledge, this repository has something for you. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!

Special thanks to iNeuron for providing the initial notes and resources that contributed to the creation of this repository.
